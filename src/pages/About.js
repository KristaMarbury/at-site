            Hello! I am a native Washingtonian and love the city life. My
            husband and I moved to Chicago in 2017 and quickly fell in love with
            life in the Windy City. Together, we have three daughters and one
            received a dyslexia diagnosis – just one year after I’d received my
            masters degree in teaching. I was a 12th grade English teacher and
            my 11-year old was struggling with reading and spelling. Determined
            to help her, I embarked on a journey of training that resulted in my
            becoming a Certified Academic Language Therapist. How did my
            daughter fare? She graduated from high school a year early and went
            on to complete her bachelors degree. She’s now a lover of books and
            is able to demonstrate her intelligence on paper easily. Her two
            siblings, inspired by the transformation they saw in their sister,
            went on to become Academic Language Therapists as well. That
            diagnosis in 2006 changed us as a family. We have gone on to help
            many other students and would love to help your child and you!
